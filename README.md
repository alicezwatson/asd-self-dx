**Work in Progress**

This will contain information on my journey to get an autism diagnosis, barriers, self-diagnosis, self-dx validity, and research on the topic.

### Autism Spectrum Disorders and Self-reports: Testing Validity and Reliability Using the NEO-PI-R

"Results indicate satisfactory internal consistency of the NEO-PI-R, a satisfactory factor structure, predicted correlations with clinician ratings in the ASD group, and predicted differences in personality between the ASD group and controls. In conclusion, the present results support the use of self-reported measures when assessing adults with ASD."

I've requested a copy of the paper and will add info from it when/if I have access.

# My Self-Diagnosis Test Results:

## Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ)
https://psychology-tools.com/test/autism-spectrum-quotient/score

Your score was 42 out of a possible 50.

Scores in the 33-50 range indicate significant Autistic traits (Autism).

## The AQ-10
https://embrace-autism.com/aq-10/#test

Your score was 10.

Scores of 6 or higher are indicative of autism or a significant number of autistic traits.

## Empathy Quotient (EQ)
https://psychology-tools.com/test/empathy-quotient

Your score was 15 out of a possible 80.

Scores of 30 or less indicate a lack of empathy common in people with Autism or Asperger’s Syndrome.

## Ritvo Autism & Asperger Diagnostic Scale (RAADS-14)
https://psychology-tools.com/test/raads-14

Your score was 38 out of a possible 42.

Scores of 14 and above are considered indicative of an Autism Spectrum Disorder.

## The Camouflaging Autistic Traits Questionnaire (CAT-Q)
https://embrace-autism.com/cat-q/

Your total score was 142 out of a possible 175.

| CAT-Q scores   | Neurotypical μ | Autistic μ | Your Scores |
|----------------|----------------|------------|-------------|
| Total score    | 109            | 122        | 142         |
